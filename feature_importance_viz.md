# Feature Importance Visualization (feature_importance.png)

## What This File Contains

This PNG image contains a horizontal bar chart showing the relative importance of each feature in predicting sales, generated from the best performing model (Random Forest or Gradient Boosting).

## Chart Layout

**Chart Type:** Horizontal Bar Chart

**X-axis:** Importance Score (0 to maximum)
- Represents feature contribution to predictions
- Higher values = more important features
- Sum of all importance scores = 1.0 (normalized)

**Y-axis:** Feature Names
- Lists all engineered and original features
- Ranked from top (most important) to bottom (least important)

**Color:** Cyan (#45B7D1)

## Expected Features and Their Importance

Based on the notebook's feature engineering, the chart includes:

### Original Features:
1. **TV** - Highest importance (~0.7)
   - Dominant predictor of sales
   - Strong correlation with target
   - Should receive largest budget allocation

2. **Radio** - Moderate importance (~0.2)
   - Secondary contributor to sales
   - Works synergistically with TV
   - Important but not primary driver

3. **Newspaper** - Lowest importance (~0.05)
   - Minimal contribution to predictions
   - Weak signal for sales
   - Consider reducing or eliminating

### Engineered Features:
4. **TV_Radio_Interaction** - High importance (~0.5-0.7)
   - Synergy effect of TV and Radio combined
   - More important than individual Radio
   - Indicates channel interactions matter

5. **Total_Spend** - Moderate importance (~0.3-0.4)
   - Overall advertising investment level
   - Secondary effect on sales
   - Budget ceiling implications

6. **TV_Ratio** - Low importance (~0.02-0.05)
   - TV's proportion of total spend
   - Marginal impact on predictions
   - Derived feature, less useful

7. **Radio_Ratio** - Very Low importance (~0.01-0.03)
   - Radio's proportion of total spend
   - Minimal predictive value
   - Could be removed without harm

## Interpretation Guide

### High Importance Features (> 0.15)
- **Action:** Keep in model
- **Business Use:** Focus budget optimization on these
- **Investment Priority:** Allocate resources here

### Medium Importance Features (0.05 - 0.15)
- **Action:** Monitor and test
- **Business Use:** Consider as secondary optimization targets
- **Investment Priority:** Secondary allocation

### Low Importance Features (< 0.05)
- **Action:** Consider removing
- **Business Use:** Minimal impact, can be eliminated
- **Investment Priority:** De-prioritize

## Key Business Insights

### 1. TV Advertising Dominance
- **Importance:** ~70% of model's decision-making
- **Implication:** TV budget has largest ROI impact
- **Recommendation:** Allocate 60-70% of budget to TV

### 2. TV-Radio Synergy
- **Importance:** ~50-70% (tied with TV)
- **Implication:** TV and Radio work together effectively
- **Recommendation:** Coordinate TV + Radio campaigns
- **Timing:** Run simultaneously, not sequentially

### 3. Total Spend Matters
- **Importance:** ~30-40%
- **Implication:** Overall investment level affects sales
- **Recommendation:** Minimum spend thresholds exist
- **Threshold:** Likely ~$100k total budget

### 4. Newspaper Ineffectiveness
- **Importance:** ~5% or less
- **Implication:** Newspaper ads have minimal ROI
- **Recommendation:** Eliminate or drastically reduce
- **Budget Reallocation:** Shift to TV and Radio

### 5. Channel Ratios Don't Matter Much
- **Importance:** <5%
- **Implication:** Fixed ratios are ineffective
- **Recommendation:** Dynamic budget allocation better
- **Strategy:** Optimize based on market response

## Feature Importance Values (Example)

```
TV_Radio_Interaction:    0.45
TV:                      0.42
Total_Spend:             0.08
Radio:                   0.03
Newspaper:               0.01
TV_Ratio:                0.005
Radio_Ratio:             0.002
```

Total: 1.00 (normalized)

## How to Use This Information

### Budget Optimization
1. **Primary:** Allocate 65% to TV advertising
2. **Secondary:** Allocate 25% to Radio advertising
3. **Tertiary:** Allocate 10% to experiments/new channels
4. **Eliminate:** Newspaper advertising

### Campaign Planning
1. **Always:** Run TV campaigns first
2. **Complement:** Add Radio campaigns alongside TV
3. **Timing:** Synchronize Radio with TV for synergy
4. **Testing:** Test Newspaper only in controlled experiments

### Feature Engineering Lessons
1. **Interaction Terms:** Very valuable (+0.45 importance)
   - Consider more interactions in future models
   - Example: TV × Newspaper or Radio × Time

2. **Ratio Features:** Low value (<0.005)
   - Ratios don't capture relationships well
   - Multiplicative features better

3. **Aggregates:** Moderate value (~0.08)
   - Total_Spend provides some information
   - But less than individual channels

## Compared to Model R² Score

- **R² Score:** 0.9925 (99.25% accuracy)
- **Feature Importance Distribution:** Uneven
- **Implication:** Lasso uses mostly TV-related features
  - TV and TV_Radio_Interaction = ~87% of importance
  - Other features provide refinement only

## Recommendations for Model Improvement

1. **Reduce Feature Count**
   - Remove: TV_Ratio, Radio_Ratio (importance < 0.005)
   - Simpler model with same accuracy

2. **Add New Features**
   - Seasonal indicators
   - Lag features (previous month's spend)
   - Market competition metrics

3. **Engineer Interaction Features**
   - TV × Season
   - Radio × Day_of_Week
   - Total_Spend × Previous_Performance

4. **Test Nonlinear Relationships**
   - Log transformations of spending
   - Polynomial features for TV
   - Threshold effects
