# EDA Analysis Visualization (eda_analysis.png)

## What This File Contains

This PNG image file contains 4 exploratory data analysis visualizations arranged in a 2x2 grid:

### 1. Top Left - Correlation Heatmap
- Shows correlation matrix between all variables
- Color scale: Blue (negative) → Red (positive)
- Key findings:
  - TV has strongest correlation with Sales (0.782)
  - Radio has moderate correlation with Sales (0.576)
  - Newspaper has weak correlation with Sales (0.228)
  - All features are non-negative, no collinearity issues

### 2. Top Right - Sales Distribution Histogram
- Shows distribution of Sales across 200 campaigns
- X-axis: Sales values ($k)
- Y-axis: Frequency (count)
- Key findings:
  - Distribution is roughly normal
  - Mean sales: ~$14k
  - Range: $1.6k to $27k
  - Most campaigns cluster around $10-15k range

### 3. Bottom Left - Average Advertising Spend by Platform
- Bar chart comparing average spending across channels
- Three bars: TV (red), Radio (cyan), Newspaper (blue)
- Key findings:
  - TV has highest average spend (~$147k)
  - Radio average: ~$23k
  - Newspaper average: ~$30k
  - TV receives largest budget allocation

### 4. Bottom Right - TV vs Sales Scatter Plot
- Scatter plot showing relationship between TV spend and Sales
- Points color-coded in red with transparency
- Shows clear positive correlation
- Visual pattern: Higher TV spend → Higher sales
- Linear relationship indicates good predictability

## How to Interpret

### Correlation Heatmap Reading
- Values range from -1 to +1
- Closer to +1 = stronger positive relationship
- Closer to -1 = stronger negative relationship
- Closer to 0 = no linear relationship
- Darker red = stronger positive correlation

### Distribution Interpretation
- Roughly bell-shaped: Good for regression models
- No extreme outliers: Data quality is good
- Mean = Median suggests symmetric distribution

### Spending Comparison
- Bar heights directly comparable
- Ratios indicate budget allocation patterns
- TV dominates advertising mix

### Scatter Plot Interpretation
- Points following upward trend indicate positive correlation
- Tightness of clustering indicates correlation strength
- Linear pattern suggests linear models will work well
