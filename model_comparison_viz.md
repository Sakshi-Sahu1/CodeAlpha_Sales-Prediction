# Model Comparison Visualization (model_comparison.png)

## What This File Contains

This PNG image file contains 2 model evaluation visualizations arranged side-by-side:

### Left Panel - R² Score Comparison (Horizontal Bar Chart)

**Purpose:** Compare predictive accuracy of all 5 models

**X-axis:** R² Score (0 to 1, where 1 = perfect)

**Models ranked by R² Score:**
1. **Lasso Regression** ⭐ - 0.9925 (Best)
   - Highest accuracy
   - Most reliable predictions
   - Recommended for production

2. **Ridge Regression** - 0.9883
   - Very close second
   - Alternative if Lasso unstable

3. **Linear Regression** - 0.9881
   - Baseline model
   - Simple, interpretable

4. **Random Forest** - 0.9879
   - Tree-based ensemble
   - Non-linear relationships

5. **Gradient Boosting** - 0.9860
   - Advanced ensemble
   - Slightly lower performance

**Color:** Cyan (#4ECDC4)

**Interpretation:**
- All models perform excellently (>0.98)
- Minimal difference between top models
- Lasso edges out by 0.4% over Linear
- Difference is within margin of error

### Right Panel - Actual vs Predicted Scatter Plot

**Purpose:** Show prediction accuracy visually

**X-axis:** Actual Sales ($k)
- Range: ~5k to ~27k
- True sales values from test set (40 samples)

**Y-axis:** Predicted Sales ($k)
- Same range as actual
- Predictions from best model (Lasso)

**Diagonal Line:** Perfect Prediction Line
- Black dashed line at 45° angle
- Represents perfect predictions (actual = predicted)
- Points should cluster on or near this line

**Points:** Scatter plot with transparency
- Color: Red (#FF6B6B)
- Alpha: 0.6 (semi-transparent)
- Each point = one test sample

**Interpretation:**
- Points closely follow diagonal line
- Indicates accurate predictions
- Small vertical spread = low prediction error
- No systematic bias (random scatter around line)
- Suggests model generalizes well to unseen data

## Visual Metrics

### From R² Comparison:
- **R² = 0.9925** means the model explains 99.25% of variance in sales
- Only 0.75% of variance is unexplained
- Excellent fit for business predictions

### From Scatter Plot:
- **Points on line** = Perfect predictions
- **Points above line** = Underestimated sales
- **Points below line** = Overestimated sales
- **Tight clustering** = Consistent accuracy
- **Wide spread** = Inconsistent predictions (not seen here)

## Performance Metrics Summary

| Metric | Lasso | Ridge | Linear | RF | GB |
|--------|-------|-------|--------|-----|-----|
| R² | 0.9925 | 0.9883 | 0.9881 | 0.9879 | 0.9860 |
| RMSE | 0.4851 | 0.6085 | 0.6128 | 0.6179 | 0.6641 |
| MAE | 0.3662 | 0.4480 | 0.4461 | 0.4799 | 0.4815 |

### What RMSE Means
- Lasso RMSE: 0.4851
- Average prediction error: $485 (per $1000 in sales)
- Or: ~2.3% of average sales ($14k)
- Highly accurate for business use

### What MAE Means
- Lasso MAE: 0.3662
- Median absolute error: $366 (per $1000 in sales)
- More robust than RMSE for outliers
- Shows typical prediction accuracy

## Why Lasso Regression Won

1. **Highest R² Score (0.9925)**
   - Explains 99.25% of sales variance
   - Best overall fit to data

2. **Lowest RMSE (0.4851)**
   - Smallest average prediction errors
   - Most consistent predictions

3. **Lowest MAE (0.3662)**
   - Median error is smallest
   - Robust to outliers

4. **Feature Selection**
   - Lasso performs automatic feature selection
   - Eliminates less important features
   - Results in simpler, more interpretable model

5. **Generalization**
   - Prevents overfitting better than alternatives
   - L1 regularization adds beneficial bias
   - Works well on new, unseen data

## Recommendations

1. **Use Lasso Regression** for sales predictions
   - Deploy with alpha=0.1
   - Monitor performance quarterly
   - Retrain if accuracy drops below 98%

2. **Use Linear Regression** as backup
   - If Lasso becomes unstable
   - For real-time predictions (faster computation)
   - For model interpretability

3. **Monitor Model Drift**
   - Compare predictions to actuals monthly
   - Check for systematic bias
   - Retrain if R² drops below 0.95
